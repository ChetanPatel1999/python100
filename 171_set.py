# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.  
# • Mathematically a set is a collection of items not in any particular order.  
# • There is no index attached to any element in a python set. So they do not support 
# any indexing or slicing operation.  

set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry","apple","mango"} 
print(set1)  

print("set items ....")
for item in set1:
    print(item)
